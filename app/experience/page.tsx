            <b>IKIGAI APPLICATIONS</b> is a product-driven technology studio building a new generation of high-leverage software tools for founders, creators, and modern businesses.

            We focus on identifying deep workflow pain points — places where people lose time, money, or clarity — and turning them into simple, elegant, and scalable products.
            <br /><br /><br />
            <b>Our philosophy is inspired by Ikigai:</b>
            <br />

            Building products that sit at the intersection of what people need, what they love to use, and what creates real economic value.

            Rather than betting on a single product, <b>IKIGAI</b> is structured as a multi-product company, where each application is designed to:
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Solve one specific, painfli problem</li>
              <br />
              <li>Be highly focused and easy to adopt</li>
              <br />
              <li>Scale into a standalone, profitable SaaS</li>
            </ul>

          <p>
            IKIGAI APPLICATIONS operates in stealth mode, with multiple products under development and early users already validating our approach.

            Our long-term vision is to create a portfolio of compounding software businesses — each small, powerful, and deeply loved by its users — rather than a single bloated platform.
